Between work, trying to learn React, going to the gym, and life in general, I felt like I needed a slight break. Second, I was busy and felt like I didn't have time to fully commit to the tasks I set for myself. With that being said, I'm ready to get back to it. I'm ready to buckle down and get back into a routine, but that may be difficult because during the summer months it seems like I'm going non-stop.",

They're definitely a little gimmicky, but they're fun to play with. Hopefully, I'll be able to incorporate more animations into my works in the future. I just need to remember when and when not to use them, which will come with time.",
